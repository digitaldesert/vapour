# Vapour
A standards focused, minimalistic micro framework that is focused on HTML centric developers.

## Why another framework?
The ecosystem for web frameworks is already very busy with many frameworks. While these are still very relavent and the 
goal is not to replace any of these. They all have benefits and are viable options for many project.

## Who is it for
Throughout my career I see a divide in the many IT projects in terms of skillset and passion. Generally speaking
You will generally have development teams divided between backend and frontend. This lends well to the emerging
data-centric approach we are seeing where applications are now divided into data services(e.i.API's) and client based
rendering interfaces (e.g., React, Angular, etc. ) that consume these data endpoints to create the application experience.

In this divide the skill sets tend to vary; frontend focused on client side technologies (HTML,CSS, JS) while backend
dealing with everything else (e.g., Python, Ruby, PHP, Java ) and generally there are few more backend developers since
they are also responsible for servers and deployments to a more prominent degree than the frontend developers.

### Frontend is our focus
While most backend developers can tinker and can navigate around frontend frameworks, they usually have to leverage already
built in frontend stacks that come with their backend framework, so they can focus on building services. 
For the most part this is sufficient, and many successful projects I have seen are married to a robust stack were little
no frontend code was ever required.

Yet as more and more mobile devices hit the market coupled wth the emerging focus on accessibility and user experience
the more granular control of frontend code is on the demand. Most of the popular frameworks offer a lot of control and
customization, but they also come build with a lot of opinions which has in my experience been at times hard to workaround 
without taking on a large technical debt.
